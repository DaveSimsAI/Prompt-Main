## Prompt Quality Evaluation

Use this section to self-evaluate or tune prompts before sending. Each criterion is scored from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent):

| Criterion                       | Description                                                                             | Score (1–10) |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Clarity                         | Is the prompt unambiguous and easy to understand?                                       |              |
| Language Precision              | Are the words well chosen, with technical or strategic accuracy?                        |              |
| Context Provided                | Does the prompt contain enough background for accurate answers?                         |              |
| Intent Alignment                | Does the LLM clearly understand what outcome is expected (e.g., advice, code, plan)?    |              |
| Token Efficiency                | Is the prompt concise and free of filler or redundancy?                                 |              |
| Scope Appropriateness           | Is the prompt specific enough without being overly narrow or too broad?                 |              |
| Reusability                     | Could this prompt be reused with minimal changes for a similar purpose or audience?     |              |
| Complexity Handling             | Is the prompt structured to support multi-step or layered reasoning if needed?          |              |
| Response Quality Predictability | Would the prompt likely yield a useful and complete response from a capable LLM?        |              |
| Prompt-LLM Fit                  | Does the prompt match the capabilities and format expectations of the model being used? |              |

> **Tip:** A high-quality prompt should score at least 8 in most categories.
